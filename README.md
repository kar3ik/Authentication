This repository contains a simple backend Node.js program that demonstrates the integration of various popular libraries and tools to create a basic authentication system. The technologies used in this project are as follows:

JSON Web Token (JWT): For generating and handling authentication tokens securely.
Cookie Parser: To manage and parse cookies in the HTTP request/response.
Express.js: A fast and minimalist web framework for Node.js.
bcryptjs: For securely hashing and comparing passwords.
MongooseDB: An object data modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB.
Prerequisites
Before running this program, ensure you have the following software installed on your system:

Node.js (v14 or later)
npm (Node Package Manager)
MongoDB (running locally or a remote connection)
Getting Started
Clone the repository:

git clone repository
cd repository

Install dependencies:
npm install


Configure Environment Variables:
Create a .env file in the root directory of the project and add the following variables:
PORT=3000
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
Replace your_mongodb_connection_string with the MongoDB connection string you have. Also, generate a strong random string for JWT_SECRET.

Run the Application:

npm start
The server will start running at http://localhost:3000.

The project uses the following Node.js packages:

express: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework.
jsonwebtoken: For generating and verifying JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for user authentication.
cookie-parser: To handle cookies for storing the JWT.
bcryptjs: For hashing and comparing user passwords securely.
mongoose: An object data modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB.
Conclusion
This simple backend Node.js program demonstrates how to build a basic authentication system using JSON Web Tokens, Cookie Parser, Express.js, bcryptjs, and MongooseDB. It provides the foundation for more complex applications where user authentication and data storage are required.
